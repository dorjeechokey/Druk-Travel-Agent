                <p>
                    Druk Air, the National Flag Carrier of the Kingdom of Bhutan, was established by Royal Proclamation
                    on the
                    5th of April, 1981. The history of Druk Air is synonymous with the history of aviation in Bhutan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paro airport was commissioned in 1968 but actual scheduled Civil Air transport started only with the
                    arrival of the Dornier 228 in 1983.
                    The 14th of January 1983, was an important day in the history of Druk Air. It was the day when the
                    first aircraft belonging to the Royal Government of Bhutan touched down at Paro airport, a
                    German-made Dornier 228-200.
                    <br>
                    Operations with Dornier 228 were full of delays and diversions caused by bad weather either over
                    Paro airport or at the entry point to Bhutan in the foothills. Paro airport is located in a deep
                    valley at an elevation of
                    7333 feet above sea level while the surrounding hills go up to 16000 feet and the approach into the
                    airport is entirely by visual flight rules (VFR).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actual progress in Druk Air started with the introduction of the BAe 146 in November 1988. Within a
                    short span of the introduction of the BAe 146-100, the Druk Air route network was increased to link
                    Paro with New Delhi,
                    Bangkok and Kathmandu beside the existing link with Kolkata and Dhaka. The reliability and the
                    comfort of BAe 146 slowly induced travel by air from Paro as the preferred means of travel for most
                    people.
